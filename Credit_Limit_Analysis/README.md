# Project: Credit Limit Analysis
# Brief Description:
In this project, I delved into a dataset from UCI that represents the credit limit of various bank customers. By analyzing this data, we aim to understand the distribution of credit amounts provided to customers and how these amounts vary with different sample sizes.

# Objective:
The main objective is to observe the variability of the mean, median, and mode for different sample sizes. This understanding can help in making decisions related to credit policies in banks.

# Methodology:
Loaded the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Visualized the distribution of the 'LIMIT_BAL' feature which represents the credit limit.
Randomly sampled the data and observed how the mean, median, and mode changed with sample size.

# Results:
Analysis revealed the central tendencies of the credit amounts and how they might be influenced by the size of the sample chosen. Detailed code and visualizations can be found in the repository.

# Tools/Technologies used:
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

# How to run the code:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab.
